This Flutter code creates a straightforward image picker app where users can choose an image from their device's gallery, blur a specific part of it, and save the edited image as either a file or a PDF. The app lets users input the coordinates and size of the area they want to blur, plus it features a slider to tweak the blur intensity. It also employs state management to refresh the UI based on what users do.
